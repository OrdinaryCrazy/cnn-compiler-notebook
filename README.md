# Graph Neural Network Survey

## Background

### Origin GNN

**Target problem**: learn a state embedding $\mathbf{h}_v\in \mathbb{R}^{s}$ for each node

**Traditional procedure**:

$\mathbf{h}_{v} = f(\mathbf{x}_v,edge\_attr_v,\mathbf{h}_u,\mathbf{x}_u)$
$u$ means neighbors of $v$, $f$ is local parameterized transition function
$\mathbf{o}_v = g(\mathbf{h}_v, \mathbf{x}_v)$
$g$ is local output function

**Typical loss**:

$loss = \sum_{i = 1}^{p}(target_i - output_i)$

Details can be found at [Github link](https://github.com/OrdinaryCrazy/cnn-compiler-notebook/blob/master/Studying%20Note/README.md)

### From spectral to propagation: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)

**$g_\theta(\Lambda)$ can be well-approximated by a truncated expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials $T_k(x)$ up to $K^{th}$ order:** 

$g_{\theta'}(\Lambda) \approx \sum^{K}_{k=0}\theta^{'}_{k} T_k(\widetilde{\Lambda})$
1.  $\widetilde{\Lambda} = \frac{2}{\lambda_{max}} \Lambda - I_N$, $\lambda_{max}$ denotes the largest eigenvalue of $L$
2.  $\theta' \in \mathbb{R}^{K}$: vector of Chebyshev coefficients
3.  $Chebyshev \quad polynomial: T_0(x) = 1, \quad T_1(x) = x, \quad T_k(x) = 2xT_{k-1}(x) - T_{k-2}(x)$
4.  SO: $g_{\theta '} \star x \approx U \sum^{K}_{k=0}\theta^{'}_{k} T_k(\widetilde{\Lambda})U^{\top}x = \sum^{K}_{k=0}\theta^{'}_{k} T_k(\widetilde{L})x$
1.   $\widetilde{L} = \frac{2}{\lambda_{max}}L - I_N$ 
2.  $K^{th}-order$ polynomial in the Laplacian: it depends only on nodes that are at maximum K steps away from the cantral node
3.  with $K = 1$ and $\lambda_{max} \approx 2$:
$g_{\theta '} \star x \approx \theta_{0}^{'}x+\theta^{'}_{1}(L-I_N)x = \theta^{'}_{0}x - \theta^{'}_{1}D^{-\frac{1}{2}}AD^{-\frac{1}{2}}x$
with $\theta = \theta^{'}_{0} = -\theta^{'}_{1}$ and renormalization trick $I_N + D^{-\frac{1}{2}}AD^{-\frac{1}{2}} \rightarrow \widetilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \widetilde{A} \widetilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$
from C input channelsand F filters:
$Z = \widetilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \widetilde{A} \widetilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}X\Theta$: complexity:$\mathcal{O}(|\varepsilon|FC)$
1. $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times F}$: matrix of filter parameters
2. $Z\in \mathbb{R}^{N \times F}$: convolved signal matrix

**Layer-wise propagation rule:**

$H^{(l+1)} = \sigma( \widetilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \widetilde{A} \widetilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}} H^{(l)} W^{(l)})$

$\widetilde{A} = A + I_N$: adjacency matrix with added self connection

$\widetilde{D}_{ii} = \sum_j \widetilde{A}_{ij}$:

$W^{(l)}$: layer-specific trainable weight matrix

$\sigma(\cdot)$:  activation function

$H^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$: the matirx of activations in the $l^{th}$ layer, $H^{(0)} = X$

###  Why GNN from CNN

1.   Graphs are the most typical locally connected structure
2.   Share weights reduce the computational cost compared with traditional spectral graph theory
3.   Multilayer structure is the key to deal with hierarchical patterns, which captures the featuofres of various sizes
4.   CNNs or RNNs need a specific order, but there is no natural order of nodes in graph, GNNs output is input order invarient
5.   Human intelligencce is most based on the graph, GNNs can do information propagation guided by the graph structure
6.   GNNs explores to generate the graph from non-structural data

## Hierarchically Aggregated computation Graphs (HAGs)

### Paper reading and Key idea

Represent common neighbors across different nodes using aggregation hierarchies, which eliminates redundant computation and unnecessary data transfers in both GNN training and inference.

# Motion-Vector based video Object Detection

## Tasks

### Proof of mathmatical principal of DFF

We try to proof the existence of a linear transformation that maps the feature map of key frame to the feature map of non-key frames based on the motion information:

>   Given a convolution operation $\mathbb{C}$, $\forall$ frame $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, as well as the corresponding feature maps $\mathcal{A'}$ and $\mathcal{B'}$, $\exists$ a linear transformation $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{C}^{-1}\cdot \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}} \cdot \mathcal{C}$, such that $\mathcal{B'} = \mathcal{A'} \cdot \mathcal{T} + \mathcal{\delta'}$, where $\mathcal{\delta'} = \mathcal{\delta}C$, where $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}}$ and $\mathcal{\delta}$ are motion and error information extracted from motion vector and residual map respectively.

And the error term of residual map will not explode after a sequence of convolution operations:

>   Given a convolution operation $\mathbb{C}$ with unit normality and an error information $\delta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$, the error information $\delta'$ after convolution operation enjoys convolution-invariance, *i.e.*, $\delta' = \delta C \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

### Motion Vector Feature Flow Version3

#### Idea

Rather than just scale the motion vector by 1x1 Convolutional Layer, we try to build a more complicated MV_Net try to improve the quality of motion vector used at feature map level. MV_Net is piced as following:

![](./figures/mvnet.png)

#### Result and Discussion

We get MAP@5 = 0.6225 with above MV_Net architecture, some points we discussed in the design:

*   MVFF-Object-Detection task is sensitive to the information loss in integer-times scale and width-height-same-ratio scale of movtion vector in pooling process, so we need firstly use interpolation (non-integer-times) scale to scale the movtion vector to a integer-times of
    feature map shape (16\*feat-map-width, 16*feat-map-height)

    Details can be found at [Github link](https://github.com/OrdinaryCrazy/cnn-compiler-notebook/blob/master/weekly-report/weeklyreport0819-0825.pdf)

Code find at [MVFF-Version3](https://github.com/OrdinaryCrazy/mvff-sideversions) 

File organization same as [Deep Feature Flow for Video Recognition](https://github.com/msracver/Deep-Feature-Flow)

### Motion Vector Feature Flow Version4

#### Idea

Use DMC-Net like structure to fine-tune the motion vector, try to gain more motion information form residual data under optical flow guidence.

![1566861769179](figures/1566861769179.png)
![1566862456389](figures/1566862456389.png)

DMC-Net details can be found at [Github Link]([https://github.com/OrdinaryCrazy/cnn-compiler-notebook/blob/master/Studying%20Note/DMC-Net.md](https://github.com/OrdinaryCrazy/cnn-compiler-notebook/blob/master/Studying Note/DMC-Net.md))

#### Result and Discussion

Result of MVFF-Version4-without optical flow guidence: MAP@5 = 0.5091.

Maybe we need extract optical flow from the dataset first.

Code find at [MVFF-Version4](https://github.com/OrdinaryCrazy/mvff-sideversions/tree/master/Version4) 

### Motion Vector Output Flow Step-Performance Curve

We tried different steps of MVOF to approximate the result of DFF and accelerate it, trying to analyse motion vector propagation at output level.

# Quantum Computing Learning

## First stage: From bits to qubits: Basical Concepts and Algorithm of Quantum Computing

### What Is a QPU? 

*   QPU (Quantum Processing Unit) is a co-processor 

*   QPU has ability to dramatically extend the kinds of problems that are tractable within computing. 

*   The CPU issues the QPU co-processor commands only to initiate tasks suited to its capabilities.

### Native QPU Instructions 

*   Conventional high-level languages are commonly used to control lower-level QPU instructions. 

*   Essential QPU instruction set 

### Simulator Limitations 

*   One measure of the power of a QPU is the number of qubits it has available to operate on. 

*   Each qubit added to simulation will double the memory required to run the simulation, cutting its speed in half.

### QPU Versus GPU: 

Some Common Characteristics What itâ€™s like to program a QPU:
*   It is very rare that a program will run entirely on a QPU. Usually, a program runnning on a CPU will issue QPU instructions, and later retrieve the results.
*   Some tasks are very suited to the QPU, and others are not.
*   The QPU runs on a separate clock from the CPU, and usually has its own dedicated hardware interfaces to external devices (such as optical outputs).
*   A typical QPU has its own special RAM, which the CPU cannot efficiently access.
*   A simple QPU will be one chip accessed by a laptop, or even perhaps eventually an area within another chip. A more advanced QPU is a large and expensive addon, and always requires special cooling.
*   When a computation is done, a projection of the result is returned to the CPU, and most of the QPUâ€™s internal working data is discarded.
*   QPU debugging can be very tricky, requiring special tools and techniques, Stepping through a program can be difficult, and often the best approcah is to make changes to the program and observe their effect on the output.
*   Optimizations that speed up one QPU may slow down another.
